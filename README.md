## Design and Approach

Every front end project involves a lot of boilerplate. Printer reduces the need to spend time writing boilerplate to almost zero. The principle approach of Printer is to automate anything trivial in Next.js development.

**Review the actual generated code in the [sample project](./example).**

## Comments and Feedback

Very open to comments and feedback. Very welcoming to people who open issues with reasonable constructive feedback. Please do not open PRs unless you're willing to commit code that matches the conventions and styles of the repository.

## Licensing

[AGPLv3](./LICENSE) - This applies to hard forking printer. Not to Next.js projects generated with printer.
